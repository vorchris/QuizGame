## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please report it as soon as possible. We take all security vulnerabilities seriously and will address them promptly.

To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Email the security team**: Send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with the details of the vulnerability. Include as much information as possible, such as:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Any potential impact or severity
   - Any suggested fixes or mitigations

2. **Do not disclose publicly**: Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to investigate and address it. Publicly disclosing a vulnerability before it is fixed can put users at risk.

3. **Coordinate with us**: We will work with you to understand and address the vulnerability. We may ask for additional information or clarification during the investigation process.

4. **Receive acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours. We will provide updates on the status of the investigation and any planned fixes.

5. **Credit and recognition**: If you report a valid security vulnerability, we will credit you for your contribution in our security advisories and release notes, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

Thank you for helping to keep this project secure.
